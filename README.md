# Disease-Diagnose-Forward-Chaining

Hello everyone! we've created an expert system, lets check it out!

we've created an expert system for disease diagnose (u can change it for other case).
Forward chaining is a reasoning method in rule-based systems used to reach a conclusion or solution from known facts. Hereâ€™s a simple explanation of forward chaining:
1.  Start with Known Facts: The forward chaining process begins with a set of initial known facts. These facts can be basic information already present in the system.
2.  Rules: The system contains a number of rules in the form of "if-then" statements. Each rule has a condition (if) and a conclusion (then).
3.  Check Rules: The system examines each rule to see if the condition (if) of the rule is satisfied by the existing facts. If the condition of a rule is met, the conclusion       (then) of that rule is considered true.
4.  Add New Facts: The conclusions derived from satisfied rules are added to the set of known facts.
5.  Repeat the Process: This process is repeated continuously, where the system keeps checking rules and adding new facts until no more rules can be applied or the final goal     is reached.

we took the rules and symptoms from the journal on:
